# YAMLtecture

YAMLtecture is an open-source CLI tool designed for application architects who need a simple yet powerful way to define and visualize system architectures. Using modular YAML files, YAMLtecture helps you map out components, hierarchies, and interactions while keeping everything easy to manage in version control. It allows you to define a comprehensive system configuration and then use queries to extract specific subsets for various use cases. With YAMLtecture, you can transform YAML definitions into diagrams (including Mermaid), keeping your architecture clear, version-controlled, and up to date.
