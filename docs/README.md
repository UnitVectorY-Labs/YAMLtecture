# YAMLtecture

YAMLtecture is an open-source CLI tool designed for application architects who need a simple yet powerful way to define and visualize system architectures. Using modular YAML files, YAMLtecture helps you map out components, their hierarchies, and interactions, all while keeping everything easy to manage in version control. Itâ€™s built to enable taking a single larger definition configuration and applying queries to filter down to a subset for different use cases. With YAMLtecture, you can transform your YAML definitions into diagrams (including Mermaid), keeping your architecture clear, version-controlled, and up-to-date.
